# ViT Transformers

The "ViT Transformers" project explores the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification tasks. We implement a Vision Transformer classifier using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluate its performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to understand if Vision Transformers, originally designed for language tasks, can effectively handle image classification.

## Objective

- Explore the viability of Vision Transformers for image classification.
- Implement a Vision Transformer classifier using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Compare Vision Transformers with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Methodology

- Data collection: We use the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard benchmark for image classification.
- Model architecture: We explain the Vision Transformer's unique features, such as patch division and self-attention mechanisms.
- Model training: We train the Vision Transformer using AdamW optimizer and suitable hyperparameters.
- Model evaluation: We assess the model's accuracy and efficiency on the test dataset.

## Results

The output of the "ViT Transformers" project is the ability to detect and classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of the ten predefined classes. These classes include objects like airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
